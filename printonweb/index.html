      <h2>Are music subcultures losing their definition?</h2>
      <h3>Yes I think they are</h3>

          <p>Today, thanks to the wonders of modern technology we can plug into any genre of music, anywhere, and at any time. We've opened up our iPhones to sounds from all over the world, but what does an unlimited access to music actually do for us? Not only are we becoming less committed to one genre of music, but our musical choices are also increasingly losing their ability to challenge the status quo.</p>
          <p>A far cry from the distracted youth of today, who spend their days fiddling around with selfie sticks and hashtagging themselves into oblivion, kids of generations past lived and breathed music. Music dictated what they wore, how they danced, who they hung out with and what drugs they took. No longer children, but not quite adults, these kids spent what little they had on the perfect threads and rarest vinyl, as they tried to carve out an identity outside of an oppressively conservative mainstream culture.</p>
          <p>The same outsider sense of belonging could easily be said for the Punks, Goths, Skinheads, Suedeheads, Hip Hop Heads, Rude Boys, Teddy Boys, Mods, Rockers, Ravers or any other subculture that has divided Britain's youth since the Second World War. Because, for the disgruntled kids of generations past, belonging to a subculture is what defined you. And with clearly consigned sartorial codes to match your distinct taste in music, there was no confusion as to which tribe you belonged to.</p>

          <p>Lumped together by high tuition fees, no jobs, unaffordable housing, and the fact that we grew up with Facebook - not to mention homogenized through terms such as 'Millennials' or 'Generation X/Y/Z/whatever' - today's youth is totally removed from that of generations past. Bloated from an overload of information and spoilt by our digitalized access to absolutely anything and everything, we're no longer polarized into different subcultures, and the vast range of music we listen to no longer dictates the many styles of clothes we wear. "It's much harder to keep things underground these days due to the internet creating an 'I want everything and I want it now'" generation,'' agrees Mike Pickering, who DJ'd at The Ha√ßienda during the 90s and who was one of the UK's biggest pioneers of acid house. "I think there are still many subcultures, there is just nothing quite as revolutionary."</p>
          <p>From grime to gabba, PC music to J-POP, because of the sheer wealth of choice we have today, the ease with which we have access to it (gone are the days of journeying to the black ghettos of America to find a never heard before vinyl), and how programmed we are to consume rapidly, we no longer have to commit to one genre of music like we once did. And, even then, because we experience most of our music through personal devices like our iPhones or iPods, taste in music is no longer a thing of the collective, it's much more down to the individual, which is why music subcultures are becoming increasingly less defined. This, in turn, affects the clothes we wear; because without any one genre of music dictating our sartorial choices, and the internet opening the floodgates to everything from Harajuku to health goth, normcore to Navajo, and seapunk to chola, we can click in and out of post-Internet trends, when and as we please.</p>
