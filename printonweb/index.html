          <p>Today, thanks to the wonders of modern technology we can plug into any genre of music, anywhere, and at any time. We've opened up our iPhones to sounds from all over the world, but what does an unlimited access to music actually do for us? Not only are we becoming less committed to one genre of music, but our musical choices are also increasingly losing their ability to challenge the status quo.</p>
          <p>A far cry from the distracted youth of today, who spend their days fiddling around with selfie sticks and hashtagging themselves into oblivion, kids of generations past lived and breathed music. Music dictated what they wore, how they danced, who they hung out with and what drugs they took. No longer children, but not quite adults, these kids spent what little they had on the perfect threads and rarest vinyl, as they tried to carve out an identity outside of an oppressively conservative mainstream culture.</p>

          <p>Lumped together by high tuition fees, no jobs, unaffordable housing, and the fact that we grew up with Facebook - not to mention homogenized through terms such as 'Millennials' or 'Generation X/Y/Z/whatever' - today's youth is totally removed from that of generations past. Bloated from an overload of information and spoilt by our digitalized access to absolutely anything and everything, we're no longer polarized into different subcultures, and the vast range of music we listen to no longer dictates the many styles of clothes we wear. "It's much harder to keep things underground these days due to the internet creating an 'I want everything and I want it now'" generation,'' agrees Mike Pickering, who DJ'd at The Ha√ßienda during the 90s and who was one of the UK's biggest pioneers of acid house. "I think there are still many subcultures, there is just nothing quite as revolutionary."</p>
